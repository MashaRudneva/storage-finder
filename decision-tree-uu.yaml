  id: 1
  info: "Sharing your data means giving specific people access to your data. Depending on the data storage solution you can give access yourself or you have to ask an administrator or data manager to give access to specific people. You find more information about access rights (read, write) in the details per solution."
  answers:
    - value: "No"

    <p>What is the impact on your research if the data turns out to be incorrect?<br>
    The classification of the impact this may have, falls in 4 categories:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Low</strong>: Incorrect data would be an inconvenience, require some rework</li>
    <li><strong>Basic</strong>: Incorrect data would invalidate research, require significant rework</li>
    <li><strong>Sensitive</strong>: Incorrect data would invalidate multiple research projects, could case reputational damage to researcher and University, lead to significant contractual violations</li>
    <li><strong>Critical</strong>: Incorrect data could have far reaching contractual obligations, exclusion from future grants or life-threatening research</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Utrecht University states that you classify your research data to determine the value of your data and the security risk that your data is exposed to. Data classification is part of the process of registering processing activities (both with and without personal information), for more on that see the <a href=""https://intranet.uu.nl/en/information-security-data-classification"">UU intranet</a>.</p>

      <p>Availability of data refers to both not losing the data wherever it is stored and being able to use that data, because the services used to process the data are working as described.</p>
