- question: "What is the classification of your data regarding confidentiality?"
  id: 4
  info: |
    <p>What is the impact if an unauthorised person gains access to the data and what if the data is leaked?</p>
    <p>You can check how to handle personal data before, during and after your research in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl">Guide Handling Personal Data.</a></p>
    <p>The classification of the impact falls in 4 categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low</strong>: Short term interruption, mainly data that’s already public or isn’t sensitive</li>
      <li><strong>Normal</strong>: Non-public research data, long term interruption or invalidation of research, personal data of moderate amount of individuals or sensitive personal data of small number of individuals</li>
      <li><strong>Sensitive</strong>: Publication restrictions, reputation damage to researcher and University, patents or contractual agreements, sensitive personal data of moderate amount of individuals or non-sensitive personal data of large number of individuals</li>
      <li><strong>Critical</strong>: Far reaching contractual obligations, exclusion from future grants or life-threatening research, highly sensitive personal data of individuals or personal data of huge number of individuals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>TUDelft states that you classify your research data to determine the value of your data and the security risk that your data is exposed to. There is a short classification available on the <a href="https://tudelft.intranet.nl">TU Delft intranet</a>.</p>
